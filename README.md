Took a TDD approach to this, discovering new things along the way. Encryption, decided to not use factory girl because in this situation it wouldent really help that much since I wanted a lot of controll over ... and would have to manually enter the credit card numbers and limits myself anyways

I read the instructions twice, went and looked up all of the relevant info about things I still didnt know

Started with orginizing my file layout with the necessary folders I would need

Started with the luhn10. I went and implemented couple different variations myself, then I went and
did research online as to...

from the luhn10 I went on to the actually credit_card class itsself

at this point I made a cipher module, but didn't implement it

then I went to the ui

a lot of testing, using rspec, and when things were unclear as to how to tests - say stin/stout

I took a tdd approach to the code

If we get further in this process I know you guys are going to ask me to extend the code, so I took advantage of modules, and orginized my files in a way that will hopefully make it easy to add new features and functionality
