#Disclaimer

- For some reason the code on github has 4 spaces for every indent. I am not quite sure why this is since my local machine looks fine with 2 spaces -- Just know that I did not do that on purpose.

#Running the app

- Running the application:
1. clone the repo
2. bundle from root
3. from root run ‘ruby app.rb’ to run the application
